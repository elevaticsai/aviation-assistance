Introduction
------------

This is a React application built with TypeScript and Vite, providing a simple chat interface using an AI assistant. The app allows users to send messages and receive responses from the AI assistant.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started, simply clone this repository or download the code manually. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` in your terminal.

Features
---------

*   Simple chat interface with a built-in AI assistant
*   Real-time messaging functionality
*   Support for typing indicators and emoticons
*   Optional AI response generation

Usage
-----

1.  Start the application by executing `npm run dev`
2.  Open your web browser and navigate to the application's URL (e.g., [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/))
3.  Type a message in the input field and press Enter to send it
4.  The AI assistant will respond with its generated response

Development
------------

*   Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix: `git branch feature/new-feature`
*   Make changes to the code, commit them, and push the changes to the remote repository: `git add .`, `git commit -m "Description of changes"`, `git push origin feature/new-feature`
*   When ready to merge your changes into the main branch, run `git checkout master` and then `git merge feature/new-feature`

To add new features or fix bugs, follow these steps:

1.  Create a new file in the `src` directory for the new component.
2.  Import the necessary dependencies in the component's JavaScript file.
3.  Implement the component's functionality using React hooks.
4.  Test the component individually before integrating it into the main application.

Note: This README is written in Markdown format, which can be easily parsed and displayed by most text editors or platforms.
